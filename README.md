<h2 align="left">The game</h2>

###
**An interface that implements the game Bulls&Cows as follows**:
- The program will choose a 4 digits number ( without repititions ) and the user will try to guess the chosen number

- For every guess, the program will present the guesses number along with the number of correct hits ( bulls ) and the number of digits that the original number contains, but not in the correct possition ( cows )

- For example: Given the number '1307' and the guess '3201' -> The result will be 1 Bulls & 2 Cows

- The user will keep on guessing untill he will discover the number. In that case, the prgoram will presents the total guesses made by the user

- The input & output both will be presented by a dialog box using JOptionPane, that also will display all of the previous guesses, including the results for every guess
